Nodejs Master Class Assignment #6

Homework Assignment #6
The Assignment:

Of all the modules we just explored, the Cluster module is likely the most important for performance. In this homework assignment, please return to your "Hello World" API from the first homework assignment, and refactor it to run across all the cores of your machine (using the cluster module).

When a request comes in, it should respond to it just as normal (only once).


Video Component:

Make a screencast showing off the code you wrote for this assignment. Walk us through your file(s), line by line, explaining what the code means and why you wrote it the way you did. Then, start your application from the command-line and interact with it (using an HTTP client) to show off the required functionality. If you're comfortable doing so, please narrate as you go and explain what you're showing us.
